# SubnetCalculator
This subnet calculator allows you to easily split a network into subnets of any size. The calculator assists you by informing about size limits of the subnets.

# Libraries
The development of this tool was also a challenge to me to use as few libraries as possible. For this reason I chose to only use the "[xlsxwriter](https://xlsxwriter.readthedocs.io/)" package.
I also decided not to use the conversions between number systems provided by Python.
Therefore the project combines a lot of topics. You will find parts of boolean algebra, conversions from binary to decimal in two's complement, as well as the general programming in Python and especially knowledge about subnets.
